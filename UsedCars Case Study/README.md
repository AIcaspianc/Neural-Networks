**Used Cars Pricing Prediction: A Case Study by Ucars**

Background: In the last decade, car production has escalated significantly, peaking at nearly 92 million units in 2019. This surge has notably bolstered the used car sector, transforming it into a burgeoning market. New car prices are set by manufacturers and are further augmented by various government-imposed taxes. Buyers of new cars trust the value of their investment. However, the escalating costs of new vehicles, coupled with some buyers' financial constraints, have pivoted interest towards the used car market, sparking a global rise in its sales. This shift underscores the importance of a reliable model for predicting secondhand car prices, considering an array of vehicle attributes.

**Project Goal** :

At Ucars, we specialize in estimating used car prices. Numerous customers seek our expertise to understand the value of the used cars they intend to purchase. As a Data Scientist on the Ucars team, your mission is to create a model that effectively predicts the prices of these used cars.

**Data Attributes:**

- Model: Car's brand and specific model.
- Year: Release or edition year of the model.
- Transmission: Type of transmission (Automatic/Manual).
- Mileage: Car's standard mileage (in kmpl or km/kg).
- Price: Current market price.
- Color: Car's color.

**Educational Takeaways:**

- Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Preparing data for training.
- Developing a basic regression model using Neural Networks.
- Performing price predictions with the model.

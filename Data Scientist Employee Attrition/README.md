### Data Scientist Employee Attrition - Job Change of Data Scientists**

###  Problem Statement

Those who successfully complete the company's courses are considered for employment as data scientists by a big data and data science company. Enrollment in their training is quite high. It helps to cut costs and time as well as improve the quality of training or organising the courses and applicant categorization, so the employer wants to know which of these candidates want to work for the company after training or are seeking for new employment. Candidates supply personal, educational, and professional details during the enrollment and signup process.

This dataset is helpful for HR research because it aims to comprehend the reasons behind an individual's departure from their current position. Using current credentials, demographics, and work experience data, you may create a model that predicts the likelihood that a candidate is seeking for a new job and interprets the key reasons influencing an employee's decision to stay on or leave.

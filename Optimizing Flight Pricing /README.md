**CASE STUDY: OPTIMIZING FLIGHT PRICING STRATEGY**

**Scenario**

- The aviation industry is highly competitive and dynamic, with pricing being a critical factor influencing customer choice and company profitability. In this case study, we explore the dataset of various flights, encompassing different airlines, journey dates, routes, and prices. The data includes key details such as the airline name, date of journey, source and destination airports, route, departure and arrival times, duration, number of stops, additional information, and the ticket price.

**Objective**

- As a Data Analyst at SkyAnalytics, a consulting firm specializing in aviation analytics, your task is to analyze this flight data to derive insights that can help an airline client optimize its pricing strategy. The goals include:
- **Understanding Flight Pricing Dynamics** : Analyze how different factors like airline choice, date of journey, route, and number of stops influence the pricing of flight tickets.
- **Predictive Modeling** : Develop a predictive model that can forecast flight prices based on various input features. This model will help the client in setting competitive and profitable ticket prices.
- **Identifying Key Influencers** : Determine which factors most significantly impact flight prices and provide recommendations on how the airline can adjust these factors to optimize revenue.
- **Market Trend Analysis** : Examine seasonal and temporal trends in flight pricing to advise the airline on peak periods and potential opportunities for special pricing or promotions.

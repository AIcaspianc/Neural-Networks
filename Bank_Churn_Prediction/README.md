**Case Study: Bank Customer Churn Prediction**

**Scenario**

In the banking sector, customer retention is crucial for sustained business growth. This case study revolves around a dataset from a bank, which includes information on customer demographics, account details, and whether the customer exited (churned) the bank. Key data points include customer ID, credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, account balance, number of products used, credit card status, activity status, estimated salary, and churn status.

**Objective**

As a Data Scientist at FinInsights, a consultancy specializing in financial analytics, your task is to analyze this dataset to understand the factors leading to customer churn and predict the likelihood of churn for existing customers. The objectives include:

1. **Churn Analysis** : Analyze customer demographics and account details to identify patterns and trends in churn.
2. **Predictive Modeling** : Develop a machine learning model to predict the probability of a customer leaving the bank. This model will help the bank identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to retain them.
3. **Identifying Key Factors** : Determine which customer attributes most significantly contribute to churn, enabling targeted customer retention strategies.
4. **Customer Segmentation** : Segment the customer base based on risk of churn and other key attributes for more tailored marketing and retention strategies.

**Data Attributes**

- **CustomerID** : Unique identifier for the customer.
- **CreditScore** : Credit score of the customer.
- **Geography** : Customer's location.
- **Gender** : Customer's gender.
- **Age** : Customer's age.
- **Tenure** : Number of years the customer has been with the bank.
- **Balance** : Account balance of the customer.
- **NumOfProducts** : Number of bank products the customer is using.
- **HasCrCard** : Indicates if the customer has a credit card.
- **IsActiveMember** : Indicates if the customer is an active member.
- **EstimatedSalary** : Customer's estimated salary.
- **Exited** : Indicates whether the customer has left the bank (churned).

**Approach**

- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing** : Examine the dataset for patterns, missing values, and outliers. Preprocess the data for analysis and modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct thorough EDA to uncover insights and relationships in the data.
- **Feature Engineering** : Develop new features that could enhance the model's predictive power.
- **Model Development and Validation** : Utilize various machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model. Validate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Recommendations and Insights** : Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the model's findings to help the bank reduce customer churn.

**Expected Outcomes**

- Detailed analytical report with key findings and visualizations.
- A reliable predictive model for customer churn.
- Strategic action plan based on the model's insights for reducing churn.
